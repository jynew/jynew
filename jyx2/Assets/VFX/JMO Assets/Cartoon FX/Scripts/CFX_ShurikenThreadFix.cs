// Drag/Drop this script on a Particle System (or an object having Particle System objects as children) to prevent a Shuriken bug
// where a system would emit at its original instantiated position before being translated, resulting in particles in-between
// the two positions.
// Possibly a threading bug from Unity (as of 3.5.4)
