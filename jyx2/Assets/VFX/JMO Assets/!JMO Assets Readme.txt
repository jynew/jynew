JMO Assets
© 2013, Jean Moreno
===================

Thanks for your download(s)! :)

You will find in addition to your package(s) a new menu option: "Window/JMO Assets/"
This will help you determine if you need to update any package, or send an email if you need support.


"Window > JMO Assets > Check for updates"
------------------------------------------
Opens a window that checks for updates for all JMO Assets, and brings you to the product Asset Store page in one click!
The Readme files are used to check the local version, so the plugin will not see the local version if these are deleted. You can freely change the location of the plugins though in the Assets folder though.


"Window > JMO Assets > Support email"
------------------------------------------
Opens your default mail client to send an email to jean.moreno.public+unity@gmail.com if you need support, or anything else.
