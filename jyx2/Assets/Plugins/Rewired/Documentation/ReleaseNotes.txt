1.1.41.5:

  Bug Fixes:
    - Control Mapper: Fixed compiler error in Text Mesh Pro version of Control Mapper introduced in 1.1.41.4.

1.1.41.4:

  Changes:
    - Added attempted workarounds to hopefully prevent API updater from seeing any calls to Texture2D.Resize in the Rewired_Core.dll assembly. A new Unity bug in the API updater in 2021.2 was causing it to crash on Rewired_Core.dll because of the use of Texture2D.Resize. This prevented Rewired_Core.dll from being loaded, completely breaking Rewired. The issue seems to be intermittent, not reproducible in every project, but in some projects likes ones upgraded from prior versions of Unity. This issue was not caused by Rewired but by Unity's API updater.
    - Changed Corgi Engine integration to use reflection to get value of base InventoryInputManager.InventoryOpen because of breaking changes changing the name of this field to InventoryInputManager.InventoryIsOpen with no way to branch code to support both versions.

  Bug Fixes:
    - OSX Standalone, Native: Fixed Xbox Wireless Controller (Xbox Series S/X controller) view button not working.
    - Control Mapper: UI no longer gets stuck in a bad state when changing language while a popup window is open.

1.1.41.3:

  Bug Fixes:
    - OSX Standalone, Native, Enhanced Device support enabled: Fixed Dual Shock 4 axes not working when connected via USB bug introduced in 1.1.41.2.


1.1.41.2:

    Bug Fixes:
      - Unity 2021.2+, Windows Standalone, Raw Input, Direct Input w/ Native Mouse/Keyboard Handling: Fixed bug in processing Raw Input messages on 32-bit builds running on 64-bit Windows resulting in Unity logging "Invalid raw input data size" messages when using certain controllers.
      - Reworked Rewired Editor handling of prefabs in versions of Unity that use the new prefab workflow due to new errors caused by recent updates to Unity resulting in data not being saved when modifying data in a prefab using the Rewired Editor.
      - Rewired Input Manager "Don't Destroy on Load" setting is set properly when Rewired Initializer is a child of a GameObject and instantiates the Rewired Input Manager as a child of that parent GameObject.
      - Fixed Global Options Window not displaying any information.

1.1.41.1:

    Changes:
      - Added warning to Rewired Input Manager editor to warn users to set Joystick Auto Assignment Max Joysticks Per Player to 100 if a single-player game because of how many developers ignore this setting are left with games that cannot be controlled if a virtual controller or another controller is connected to the system that takes priority other than the one the user is trying to use.

    Bug Fixes:
      - Unity 2021.2+, Windows Standalone, Raw Input, Direct Input w/ Native Mouse/Keyboard Handling: Fixed bug in new Raw Input event forwarding that could cause a multiple of the number of events to be forwarded to Unity if the number of events that were received during a frame exceeded 100. This could occur after execution was resumed from a breakpoint in a debugger due to mouse and keyboard input.

1.1.41.0:

    Changes:
      - Windows Standalone, Raw Input, Direct Input w/ Native Mouse/Keyboard Handling: Raw Input messages are now retrieved using GetRawInputBuffer method due to changes to Unity input in Unity 2021.2+ that breaks Rewired's Raw Input message handling due to their use of GetRawInputBuffer to eliminate massive frame rate drop from high refresh rate mice (4000-8000 Hz). Their change to GetRawInputBuffer, which consumes all the Raw Input events when called, makes it impossible for Rewired to continue to share mouse input events with Unity so both Unity's mouse input and Rewired's native mouse input work simultaneously.
      - Implemented Raw Input event forwarding to Unity through new Unity API exposed for this purpose in 2021.2.0. Bonus effect of this change is that Rewired can now be used alongside the new Unity Input System on Windows.

    Bug Fixes:
      - Null reference exception is no longer thrown when certain custom driver functions are called in Start or Awake (ex: DualShock4ControllerExtension.GetGyroscopeValue).
      - Unity Editor: Adding the Nintendo Switch Input Manager component using button on the Rewired Input Manager inspector now sets the GameObject dirty so the object gets saved correctly.
      - When first enabling the only Controller Map that binds a particular Action to the negative pole of an axis while currently holding that axis in a negative state with a value beyond the button activation threshold and querying that Action for its negative button down value will no longer return a down state.

1.1.40.0:
   
    Changes:
      - Disabling Visual Studio 2019 jump optimizer for Windows IL2CPP builds is no longer required.
      - Performance improvements.
      - UFE2 Integration: Reworked integration script again due to breaking changes in Unity causing EventSystem exceptions to be thrown.
      - UFE2 Integration: Changed supported version to 2.4.1.
      
    API Changes:
      - Changed return type of Player.ControllerHelper.GetLastActiveController<T> to T instead of Controller.
    
    Bug Fixes:
      - AxisCalibration.SetData no longer overwrites default calibration data.

1.1.39.3:

    Changes:
      - WebGL builds work again after changes to compiler in Unity 2020.2.0 to that caused builds to throw an error on launch.
      - Updated UFE2 integration to change auto show/hide of touch controls to toggle based on a screen touch and a controller press instead of toggling based on the presence of a controller due to problems with phantom joysticks that appear on some Android devices.
      - Control Mapper: Focus is now reset when calling Reset while windows are open.
   
    Bug Fixes:
      - ControllerMap.hardwareGuid is now correctly set for MouseMap, KeyboardMap, and CustomControllerMap.

1.1.39.2:
    
    Changes:
      - Missing mouse axis entries in the Unity Input Manager entries no longer cause Rewired to fail initialization, but instead log an error.
    
    API Changes:
      - Added public setter to InputManager_Base.dataFiles property.
    
    Bug Fixes:
      - Windows Standalone, Native Mouse Handling: Virtual desktop mouse delta value is no longer ~1/2 size of local mouse delta.
      - Fixed missing stick buttons mappings for Steam Controller (emulated) in Gamepad Template.

1.1.39.1:
  
    Bug Fixes:
      - Fixed IL2CPP compile errors and runtime exceptions on some platforms due to error in obfuscation introduced in 1.1.39.0.
      - Disabled debug logging in OSX builds in Unity 2020 and 2021 branches introduced in 1.1.39.0.

1.1.39.0:

    Changes:
      - Added Unity 2021.x branch.
      - Windows Native, OSX Native: Marginally improved DualShock 4 and DualSense gyro drift in computed orientation.
      - Changed inspector settings on Rewired_DirectInput.dll to explicitly exclude OSX platforms due to new Unity bug in Unity 2020.x including Windows DLLs on MacOS builds.
      - Added changes for new Xbox Wireless Controller firmware on MacOS.

  Changes:
    - Windows Standalone, Raw Input, Use XInput disabled: Implemented workaround for Steam not creating device notifications when creating or removing virtual controllers so controller changes can be detected correctly.
    - Export constants variable, class, and namespace sanitization now uses a blacklist instead of a whitelist so unicode characters such as non-English characters are no longer filtered out. (May lead to compiler errors if certain invalid characters are used in identifier strings.)
    - Bolt integration: Added PreserveAttribute to all classes to prevent Unity from stripping the classes on certain platforms.

  API Changes:
    - Added Platforms.PS4.PS4ControllerExtension.deviceHandle property.
    
  Bug Fixes:

    - Control Mapper: Null Reference Exception is no longer thrown when looking up a controller element name for an Action Element Map that maps to an invalid controller element.
    - MacOS Standalone, Native: When using multiple identical controllers that do not provide enough identifying information to differentiate the controller from the others and one controller is disconnected and reconnected, it will now be detected and re-appear in the Joysticks list.
    - Fixed bug in ComponentControls.TouchPad.pressStartDelay property causing value to always be set to float.MaxValue if set from scripting.

1.1.36.1:
    
    Changes:
      - Windows Standalone, Raw Input: Raw Input devices that do not appear as a HID device are no longer filtered out and are supported as controllers to support Steam virtual/remote devices when Use XInput is disabled.

1.1.34.1:

    Changes:
      - Added Rewired category to component menu.
      - UnityInputOverride: Made additional functions re-route to Rewired instead of passing through to UnityEngine.Input (anyKey, anyKeyDown, mousePosition, GetKey, GetKeyDown, GetKeyUp).
      - Windows Standalone, Raw Input: Added workarounds to try to prevent calling the Windows HidD_GetProductString function on HID devices until the device has been determined to be a supportable HID device in an attempt to avoid a 5-10 second stall when this function is called on certain problem HID devices. This issue is being reported with increasing frequency, I can only assume due to a new bug/change in a recent Windows update that affects a variety of different HID device types. This is not an issue with Rewired, it is an issue with the device, its driver, and/or Windows. This is merely an attempt to plaster over the problem so I don't keep getting this reported to me as an issue with Rewired.
      
    Bug Fixes:
      - Fixed bug when replacing an Action Element Map keyboard key binding with the same keyboard key causing ActionElementMap.elementIdentifierName to return a blank string. Bug was introduced in 1.1.33.0.

1.1.26.1:
    
    Changes:
      - Reverted change made in 1.1.25 due to breakage of editor stepping input support: Unity Editor, Windows Standalone, Native Keyboard Handling and/or Native Mouse Handling: Pausing runtime Play mode in the Unity Editor now clears keyboard and mouse input queue and blocks further input from being queued while paused.
      - Changed Control Mapper UISelectionUtility.cs for breaking API change in Unity 2019.1.5f1.
      - OSX, Native: Device with location id of 0 are no longer filtered out to allow support for virtual HID devices. This change may affect some multi-controller adapters such as Gamecube adapters negatively because these devices expose additional invalid HID devices with location ids of 0 which will no longer be filtered out.

1.1.26.0:

    Changes:
      - Button down events are no longer enqueued for Fixed Update when Time.timeScale is 0 to work around issues when unpausing Time.timeScale when using Fixed Update for input.
      - Changed installer modal dialogs to work around an extremely rare issue where installation dialog boxes will be spammed with "Cancel" requests repeatedly and infintely by Unity or some other software installed causing the "Get More Information" action to be called repeatedly which opens browser windows until the system crashes. The new behavior when this issue occurs will be that the modal box will be cancelled and skipped and the user will never even see it. This is not a bug in Rewired code that caused this issue and it could not be "fixed" and will never work properly in the rare circumstance that the user's system is behaving this way. Something outside Rewired (Unity or some other software installed) is trying to force close the modal box in the Unity Editor every frame. It's a choice between a system crash or auto-skipping the installation modal. This change is simply a cludge to at least prevent the system from crashing.
      - Improved performance of inspector Debug Information tool after changes made in 1.1.25.0 to remember previously open items.

      - Added ComponentControls.TouchPad.axis2DCalibration property.

1.1.25.2:
    
    Changes:
      - Joystick polling system now ignores Axis Calibration Sensitivity settings when polling axes so a very low Multiply sensitivity value doesn't prevent users from assigning axes to Actions.
      - Player.ControllerHelper.MapHelper.LoadDefaultMaps now clears Joystick Map history for Joysticks that were previously assigned to the Player but are currently not assigned at the time the method is called. This is done so that the next time a Joystick is re-assigned after LoadDefaultMaps is called while the Joystick is not present, the Joystick will load the default Joystick Maps from the Rewired Input Manager instead of loading from its history.

    Bug Fixes:
      - Controller.Button double press method overloads with no Speed argument now work correctly.
      - Fixed incorrect Whammy Bar axis calibration in XInput Guitar controller definition.
