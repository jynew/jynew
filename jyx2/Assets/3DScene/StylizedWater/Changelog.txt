v1.28
Beta shader:
- Corrected transparency

- "Depth" tab and "Depth darkness" parameter have been removed from the inspector
- Intensified the Rim color by default, which can be toned down by the color's alpha channel

v1.27
This version includes a separate unity package which contains a Beta shader. It's targeted at desktop, mobile shaders will follow suit later.
The minimum support version is Unity 5.4

It features:
- Recreated in Amplify Shader Editor entirely

- Skybox lighting
- Reflection Probe support
- Mask surface highlight by heightmap (wave foam)
- Wave direction configuration
- Improved texture crosspanning

Changed:
- Set prefabs on "Water" layer (default built-in layer)

v1.26
Added:
- Option to use intersection texture for Surface highlights (desktop only)

- Increased default Anisotropic Filtering value for normal and shader map
- Surface highlights masks out the normal map to simulate thickness (desktop only)
- Surface highlights are now also affected by overall Transparency, to ensure correct color values (desktop only)

Fixed:
- Missing Transparency parameter in inspector when using the Mobile Basic shader
